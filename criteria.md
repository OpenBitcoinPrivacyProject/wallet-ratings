## Description

Version 0.1 (Request for Public Comment)

This document outlines the OBPP criteria for rating the privacy strength of Bitcoin wallets. A separate document will describe the relative importance of each criterion and how per-wallet scores are calculated. 

Our metrics are based on feature completeness and user experience. To evaluate user experience, we utilize a "minimum number of clicks to perform action" metric. This metric is easily standardized between wallets, minimizes subjectivity, and can be measured by a single tester.

Each sub-category of privacy, such as "Change Address Generation," is broken down into between one and three areas of consideration, including usability, quality, and user feedback.

## Criteria

<ol type="I">
	<li><strong>Receiving Addresses</strong>
		<ol type="A">
			<li><em>Generation</em>
				<ol>
					<li>Usability:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Number of clicks required to deviate from the default receiving functionality and generate a new receiving address for an existing wallet.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Feedback:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Receiving addresses are hidden from the default view once they have been used?</li>
							<li>Preemptively indicates a loss of privacy when user elects to receive funds at a previously-used addresses?</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em>Backup</em>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Usability:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Number of clicks to backup a newly-generated receiving address from an existing wallet (worst case), from the default window/authenticated home page.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Quality:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Does the backup process leak information about wallet addresses (e.g. each time a new change address is created on-demand, an email backup is triggered immediately)?</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Feedback:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Indicates a reduction in wallet safety when receiving address backups are stale?</li>
						</ol>

						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Feedback:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Change addresses are hidden from the normal receiving workflow by default to discourage using them as receiving addresses?</li>
